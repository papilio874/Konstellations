Konstellations is what will hopefully be a culmination of all things planet-pack on an incredible scale.

I hope to recieve permission to integrate (by which I mean copy nearly-verbatim but reformat for ease of reading and occasionally make small edits to suit my aesthetic) numerous planet packs from all reaches of the astronomy-spaceflight simulator community, including Kerbal Space Program, Celestia, and Space Engine.
