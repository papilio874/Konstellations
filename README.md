Konstellations is what will hopefully be a culmination of all things planet-pack on an incredible scale.



I hope to recieve permission to integrate (by which I mean copy nearly-verbatim but reformat for ease of reading and occasionally make small edits to suit my aesthetic) numerous planet packs from all reaches of the astronomy-spaceflight simulator community, including Kerbal Space Program, Celestia, and Space Engine.

- 003-000-000 Sol System
  - Sol
  - Mercury
  - Venus
  - Earth-Moon
  - Mars
  - Ceres
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn
  - Uranus
    - The texture for Uranus' surface and rings are both modified versions of original work by Deviantart user *Snowfall-The-Cat*.
    - This was done using image-editing software to piece together and reconstruct an equilateral projection from the color-edited cubemap faces used by Space Engine v. 0.990.
    - The ring texture was cropped to the section used to render the illuminated side, or the side receiving starlight. Unless and until the Kopernicus ring shader exactly matches the one used in Space Engine, this is the method that will be used to create similar rings in Kerbal Space Program. 
  - Neptune
  - Pluto-Charon
