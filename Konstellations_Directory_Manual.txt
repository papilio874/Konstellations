// The Konstellations Galaxy Pack systematically assigns a unique address
// number to each body included - this makes it easy to locate all planets
// belonging to one system, for instance.

// the address number contains four or more sub-numbers each denoting a part of the body's location in the "family tree", if you will. 
// Take our real-life solar system's Jupiter for instance:
// [003]-000-000-006_Jupiter
// The "003" indicates that this body is located in Sector Three of the galaxy, which contains all of the relevant real-world stars.
//
// 003-[000]-000-006_Jupiter
// Now let's focus on the secong number in the sequence: Konstellation. In all Sectors except Sector Two, this is the number of the konstellation that a system is a part of. 
// If the second number is 000, then the object in question is not actually a member of a konstellation but is instead the primary home system for that sector.
// in order: Sector Zero - GCSBH; Sector One - Kerbol; Sector Two - Alternis (Here the term "konstellation" gains a second meaning, indicating what planet pack the system is copied from.); Sector Three (Sol) Real-Life; Sector Four; Sector Five

// 003-000-[000]-006_Jupiter
// the third number in the address is the number of the system in its konstellation: 000 is Alpha <>, 002 is Beta <>, and so on. 
// The only exceptions to this are again the primary home systems, for which it is always 000.

// The fourth number indicates the object's position in the sequence by least-to-greatest semi-major axis (average orbital distance to its parents[s]) of objects in the system specified by the last three numbers.
//for example in the Sol System, indicated by first three address numbers 003-000-000, our sun, the system primary Sol, is indicated by the address "003-000-000-000_Sol". 
It is followed by 003-000-000-001_Mercury, 003-000-000-002_Venus, and so on.

//fifth numbers in addresses are only applicable to moons and objects in binaries or larger systems. Again, they are ordered by least to greatest average distance to their parent. 
Let's look at a complicated and less intuitive example of this. Our Home Planet, Earth, orbits a common barycenter with the Moon. 
Because it is the primary child of the barycenter, the respective adresses are: 
003-000-000-004_Earth-Moon_Barycenter, 003-000-000-004-000_Earth, and finally 003-000-000-004-001_Moon.
